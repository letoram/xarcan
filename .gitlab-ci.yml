# DEBIAN_TAG is the tag of the docker image used for the build jobs. If the
# image doesn't exist yet, the docker-image stage generates it.
#
# In order to generate a new image, one should generally change the tag.
# While removing the image from the registry would also work, that's not
# recommended except for ephemeral images during development: Replacing an
# image after a significant amount of time might pull in newer versions of
# gcc/clang or other packages, which might break the build with older commits
# using the same tag.
#
# After merging a change resulting in generating a new image to the main
# repository, it's recommended to remove the image from the source repository's
# container registry, so that the image from the main repository's registry
# will be used there as well.  You can manage your images on your fork of:
# https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/container_registry
